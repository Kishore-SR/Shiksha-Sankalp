#  Shiksha Sankalp

## About Hackathon

This project was developed as part of the **Innovation 4 Education Equity Hackathon**, organized by ShikshaLokam under the **Shikshagraha** movement. The hackathon aims to uplift 1 million public schools by 2030 through localized action, collective leadership and systemic change.

## Theme

We chose **Theme 2: "Shiksha Chaupal - Understanding the Stories from the Ground"**. This theme focuses on documenting and empowering grassroots education initiatives led by women‚Äôs collectives, which play a crucial role in improving education equity.

`Shiksha Sankalp - A Commitment to Education`  
Our project, **Shiksha Sankalp**, provides a platform to record, analyze and scale these efforts.
